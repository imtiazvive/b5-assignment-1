#### Question: What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
Ans: In TypeScript, both interface and type are used to define the shape of data, such as what properties an object should have and what types those properties are. At first, they may seem the same, and in many basic cases, they do the same job. For example, if you're creating a User object with name and age, you can use either one. But as you go deeper, you’ll notice some important differences. Interfaces are mainly designed for working with objects and are great when you want to create reusable, extendable structures. We can extend one interface from another or even multiple interfaces at once, which is helpful when your code grows bigger and more complex. Interfaces also support declaration merging - this means if you declare the same interface twice, TypeScript will combine them into one. This can be helpful in large projects, especially with third-party code.

On the other hand, type is more flexible. It can describe objects, primitives, unions (string | number), intersections, and even function signatures. For example, if you want to say a variable can be either a number or a string, only typing can do that. While type can be extended too, it doesn't support declaration merging. Another small difference is readability - interfaces are often easier to read and understand when working with objects, especially for new developers.

So, which one should you use? The TypeScript team recommends using interface for public APIs and object shapes, and type for everything else. But honestly, it's okay to choose whichever feels easier for you when you're starting. As you write more TypeScript, we’ll get a better feel for when to use each one. Just remember - they’re both tools to help you write safer, clearer code.


#### Question: What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful?
Ans: Type inference in TypeScript is a feature that lets the compiler automatically figure out the type of a variable, function return, or expression without you having to write it explicitly. For example, if you write let count = 5, TypeScript knows that count is a number - We don’t need to say: number. This is because it looks at the value and guesses the type based on that. This might sound like a small thing, but it’s very powerful and helpful, especially when writing a lot of code. It reduces the need to repeat ourselves and keeps our code clean and readable. At the same time, we still get the strong type checking that TypeScript is known for. If we later try to assign a string to that same count variable, TypeScript will show an error, because it has already inferred that count should be a number.
Type inference also works in functions. If our function adds two numbers and returns the result, TypeScript will automatically know the return type is a number, even if we don’t explicitly write a number after the function. This helps speed up development while still protecting you from common errors. It also makes our code easier to refactor and maintain, since the types will often update automatically when we change the logic.

There are even more advanced examples, like inferring types in arrays, object destructuring, and generic functions. But as a beginner, the main thing to understand is this: TypeScript is smart enough to guess types for me in many cases, so we don’t always need to write them, but we still get the safety and help of static typing. That’s why type inference is such a useful and beginner-friendly feature of TypeScript.
